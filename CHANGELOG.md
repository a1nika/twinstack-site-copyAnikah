# Changelog

<!-- changelog-since: 2026-09-23T04:51:23.499Z -->
Tracking changes committed since 2026-09-23. Regenerated on every
`npm run scaffold` — do not hand-edit, it will be overwritten. This is a
readable trail, not a rollback tool: to actually undo something, use `git
log` and `git revert`/`git checkout` as normal.
